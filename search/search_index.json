This has been the source of many hairs being pulled out when folks do not realize why they can not connect.</p> <p>Of course, there is a more modern solution to fix this issue, using a Node Number Extension with an assigned public Node Number. In this case, you would have a unique node number that can be set-up and just not registered to the ASL network (just comment out the appropriate registration line in <code>rpt_http_registrations.conf</code>).

Failure to do so can easily result in you modulating distorted audio, as well as potentially causing adjacent channel interference due to excessive deviation or splatter. </p> <p>Radio equipment such as HTs or mobile radios, and many electronics products such as VOIP phones often restrict end-user audio adjustment capabilities to ensure consistent audio levels. AllStarLink nodes and USB interfaces however, generally allow greater flexibility and thus extra attention is required to be sure your audio interface gains are properly matched to the external audio input and output levels. Failure to calibrate your audio levels could mean your node is much quieter or louder than it should be when linked to other nodes, which could be disruptive to other users and systems. It can also mean that the signal from your RF transmitter may cause interference with other radio systems, which carries serious consequences from spectrum regulators.</p> <p>Most nodes use the <code>SimpleUSB</code> channel driver (<code>chan_simpleusb</code>). Nodes that require more advanced features such as DSP squelch detection, CTCSS tone encode/decode, or additional audio filtering options may use the <code>USBRadio</code> channel driver (<code>chan_usbradio</code>). These channel drivers both have tune utilities for setting audio levels and other functions. Once a node has been configured in the <code>asl-menu</code> Node Settings, you will end up in the appropriate tune application. The following options should then be used to check and optimize audio level settings:</p> <p>NOTE: Be sure you are not connected to any other nodes when doing any of the following tests and adjustments.</p> <ul> <li><code>Set Rx Voice Level (using display)</code> provides a level meter. Talk at a normal and steady volume into the microphone and be sure that the average level does not go past the \"3KHz\" point, and that peak levels do not go significantly past the \"5KHz\" point. Note that for proper mic technique you should talk no closer than 2 to 3 inches (5 - 10 cm) from the microphone, and it should be held at an angle to minimize pops/plosives. Once you see where the audio levels are, hit the Enter key and you'll then be prompted to change the setting. If for example the current setting is 500 and your levels were too high, try entering 400 for a new value and then repeat the test. Continue to iteratively adjust the settings until the average audio levels stay around the \"3KHz\" mark. For a more precise calibration with radio nodes a 1KHz test tone can be input into another radio at a level that results in 3KHz FM deviation, then calibrate the node to the 3KHz mark, however this can be more complicated to set up and may not account for other differences such as different mics or mic gain settings.</li> <li><code>Set Transmit A Level</code>, <code>Set Transmit B Level</code> (or <code>Set Transmit Voice Level</code> for USBRadio) allow the node audio output levels to be set. For nodes connected to a radio transceiver the level should be set such that the transmitted FM deviation is no higher than 3KHz, and the audio does not sound distorted or overly loud. When listening on another radio it can also be helpful to confirm the audio levels from your node sound about the same as levels on FM repeaters in your area.</li> <li><code>Toggle RX Boost</code> enables a preamp in the CM1xx for use with very low mic-level input signals. This should be disabled in almost all cases.</li> <li><code>View Rx Audio Statistics</code> shows precise audio level information. If when running this option and talking at a normal to loud volume into your mic, you see <code>Pk</code> levels of any higher than -3.0 dBFS, <code>Avg Pwr</code> levels of higher than -12 dBFS, or any <code>ClipCnt</code> value greater than 0, you should reduce your rxmix setting (using the <code>Set Rx Voice Level</code> menu option), and then repeat this step. \"dBFS\" is a logarithmic unit of measurement, where 0dBFS equals the Full-Scale (largest possible) value of a digital signal. Digital signals cannot exceed 0dBFS. If an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is over driven, clipping, distortion and greatly reduced audio quality results.</li> <li><code>Toggle Echo Mode</code> will record each of your transmissions and echo (\"parrot\") back to you. After setting your levels with the above menu options first, echo tests are the final step to confirm your audio is clear and intelligible. If anything does not sound right or you have any questions be sure to visit the AllStarLink Community for additional help. When done with Echo Mode testing don't forget to disable it. DTMF commands can be enabled to make it easy to do echo testing any time. To enable <code>parrot mode</code> DTMF commands uncomment the 3 lines in <code>/etc/asterisk/rpt.conf</code> that start with <code>921 =</code>, <code>922 =</code>, and <code>923 =</code>. Then, restart Asterisk or reboot the node. Entering <code>*921</code> on a DTMF keypad will then enable parrot mode and <code>*922</code> will disable it.</li> <li><code>Print Current Parameter Values</code> shows the current audio level settings.</li> <li><code>Write (Save) Current Parameter Values</code> saves any changed settings to disk. Be sure to execute this option before exiting the menu if you have changed any settings and want those to be the new defaults.</li> </ul> <p>The tune utilities can also be run from the command line without needing to use <code>asl-menu</code>. For SimpleUSB run <code>sudo /usr/sbin/simpleusb-tune-menu</code> or for USBRadio run <code>sudo /usr/sbin/radio-tune-menu</code>.</p>"},{"location":"adv-topics/usbinterfaces/#eeprom-operation","title":"EEPROM Operation","text":"<p>The SimpleUSB and USBRadio channel drivers allow users to store configuration information in an EEPROM IC attached to the C-Media CM1xx USB Interface IC.

The tune menus are removing leading white space from comments (we're hoping to fix this).</li> <li>An Asterisk template is now used within <code>rpt.conf</code>, <code>simpleusb.conf</code>, and <code>usbradio.conf</code>. Editing is much easier, but it's different than with other versions of AllStar. Node settings are much simpler with only a few lines needed to be added/updated for each node. The ASL3 menu handles the new templated configuration.</li> <li>AllStar registration is now set in <code>rpt_http_registration.conf</code>, not in <code>iax.conf</code>. IAX registration still works but is discouraged. Please do not configure your node for both HTTP and IAX registration. The new Asterisk CLI command to show the registration status of your nodes is <code>rpt show registrations</code>.  This command can be performed from the ASL3 menu.</li> <li>The USB configuration files now contain the tune settings. There is no tune file for each node as in ASL2. The tune menus and the Asterisk CLI write to the new tune setting locations.</li> <li>There is no need to edit or use a script to update the access list, formerly known as the blacklist and whitelist. The settings are different because the access list is now per node rather than for all nodes as in other AllStar versions. It's also much easier to use the ASL3 menu to build the access lists.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"install/whats-new/#ap-measurement","title":"A&amp;P Measurement","text":"<p>Adoption and Performance measurements are to help ASL understand growth and technical aspects of ASL3.

Such a system is comprised of a number of receivers, located at diverse locations. The location of these receivers are chosen so that the combined coverage of all the receivers more or less fill-in the entire desired coverage area, even though it may take a number of receivers to accomplish this. All such receivers are connected (\"linked\") to a central location (generally the transmitter site), and a device compares each receiver's signal strength and selects the one with the best signal. This is called voting.</p> <p>Often in such a system, there is one single high-powered transmitter located at a central site that all mobile/portable stations would be able to receive. Sometimes, one single transmitter can not be located where coverage of the entire desired area is possible. In such cases, multiple transmitters are deployed in several locations. Since all these transmitters are on the same frequency, they must be very precisely locked to the same frequency and be transmitting the exact same audio at the exact same time. Not doing so would severely degrade their reception. This is called simulcast (transmitters).</p> <p>Traditionally, receivers that comprise a voting system are each connected to the central site via either a UHF or microwave link. Since this requires a receiver, link transmitter and link receiver for every receive site, implementation and continued cost of such a system typically becomes quite significant and in most cases prohibitive, and requires a high complexity of implementation.</p> <p>There are, however, many advantages of implementation of such a system that warrant the cost and effort required.</p> <p>With the advent of VoIP-based interconnections for radio systems, it is now possible to implement a voting system using VoIP to link the receivers to the central site, and therefore reduce the system requirements and complexity and cost by eliminating the radio links between the receivers and the central site.</p> <p>There are a few commercial vendors of VoIP-based voting systems that offer a functional and reliable, yet proprietary and extremely high-cost solution.</p> <p>Although using VoIP-based technology significantly reduces the cost and complexity of implementation of a voting system, the cost of the commercial VoIP-based devices is still quite prohibitive for all but large commercial and/or government applications. Therefore, it seemed appropriate to offer a completely open-source, open-hardware solution that makes the cost and complexity of a VoIP-based voting system nearly trivial and gives almost anyone the ability to implement this type of a system that wishes to do so.</p>"},{"location":"voter/about-voter/#history","title":"History","text":"<p>By: Jim Dixon, WB6NIL (SK)</p> <p>The Original Documentation Package (NO LONGER CURRENT) for the original VOTER system is still available. For current documentation, see the rest of the sections in this part of the manual, or the documentation of the commercially-available RTCM product.</p> <p>For a number of years, I have been asked about, and have been considering the possibility of the implementation of a multiple site remote receiver voting system that runs with VOIP on <code>Asterisk/app_rpt</code>. The more I looked into it, the more I realized that it was a FAR from a trivial task.</p> <p>The main problem to overcome is that when you have multiple streams of audio information from multiple receivers, you need a concise and accurate way of synchronizing all of the audio, so that if switching of streams occurs, there will be no inconsistencies in the audio. This is far more easily done on conventional, RF-linked voting systems, being that the delay between the receiver and the transmitter site is very minimal (basically the speed of light) and is painfully consistent. Not so on the Internet. The packet delays can be extremely long and varied, and it makes the task of synchronization far more difficult.</p> <p>The first challenge is to obtain and convey ultra-accurate time information along with the audio data, so that the transmitter site will know what time the signal was received (which may not have much to do with the time it was received at the transmitter site from the Internet). In order to accomplish this, ultra-accurate time information must be made available, and it must be processed in reasonable and consistent time for it to be meaningful.</p> <p>GPS is the simplest and most cost-effective solution to obtain ultra-accurate time information. For little money, a Garmin GPS LVC18 module (there are many others, too) may be purchased. It provides an accurate 1 pulse-per-second signal that can be used to synchronize a timing device.</p> <p>A \"host\" type computer running Linux (or UNIX, etc.) is not appropriate to be used as such a device, since it has absolutely no way of processing external inputs (or anything else, for that matter) in a consistent and predictable time. For applications that need to be accurate to hundreds of milliseconds, its fine, but for this purpose, where timing down to individual 125 microsecond audio samples is necessary, it just wont do.</p> <p>The only reasonable solution is to design hardware to accomplish this. Since hardware design is necessary, I figured that I might as well design a stand-alone board that does all the necessary functions to interface a receiver and a GPS device to an Ethernet with Internet connectivity. Certainly, a peripheral device that attaches to a \"host\" type computer would also be a reasonable solution, but for the same or less cost, it seems reasonable to eliminate the need for a \"host\" computer at receiver sites all together.</p> <p>The second challenge is determining signal strength (RSSI) information from an attached receiver. Thanks to wonderful technology designed by Steve Rodgers, WA6ZFT, which is a small board that implements a VERY high-quality squelch processor, I was able to take the code and front-end design, include it in my design, and not only is it very good squelch processor, but it also is able to provide information from which the signal strength of the received signal may be calculated.</p> <p>The third challenge is at the transmitter site end (where the <code>app_rpt</code> system is located) taking all of the streams of audio from the various receivers and synchronizing them via included time information, and making a reasonable decision on which stream to \"use\", based upon signal strength and quality. The synchronization is done with basically a \"multi-dimensional jitter buffer\" and is implemented in the Asterisk channel driver that I wrote for this application, <code>chan_voter</code>.</p> <p>The fourth challenge is to facilitate a method of testing the protocol and its implementation within <code>app_rpt</code>. Obviously, there is no way to have a \"real\" environment available, where there are multiple receivers, mobiles, etc., so a simulator has to be created.</p> <p>I'm VERY sorry and embarrassed to say so, but I wrote it in Java (yuck!). It seemed the most reasonable way to accomplish what was necessary. It simulates up to 10 channels of audio, and has \"sliders\" so that you have full control of \"RSSI\" and \"TIME DELAY\" for each channel, in addition to selecting which, if any channels are being sent to the host. You can run it, if you desire. This is the VoterSim tool.</p> <p>I also made a new UDP-based protocol for this technology, (called \"VOTER\"), which may be viewed here, if desired.</p>"},{"location":"voter/about-voter/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>In order to successfully implement a VoIP-based solution for this purpose, it is necessary to have a precise time reference in order to be able to re-assemble (time-wise) the audio streams at the central site, since VoIP has inherent inconsistencies in time delay (jitter and such). Clearly, the best and most reasonable and economic source of such precise timing data is GPS. Therefore, a GPS receiver (with a 1 pulse per second output) must be made available at each receiver location (along with the central site).</p> <p>Since precise timing is necessary, it precludes the use of any implementation which relies on a traditionally host-based operating system, such as Linux or UNIX, because of limitations of timing and scheduling precision and latency.</p> <p>Therefore, a dedicated hardware device with a simple embedded micro-controller was necessary to accomplish the necessary precise timing requirements. In addition, low cost (in comparison with a host-based solution) makes placing such a simple dedicated hardware device at each receiver location a great advantage.</p> <p>Such a dedicated hardware solution significantly increases reliability, has a far lower power consumption, and is physically smaller (in comparison with a host-based solution).</p> <p>The \"central site\" functionality (the device which receives all of the VoIP-based audio streams from the receivers and selects which receiver's audio to use) is implemented as a channel driver (<code>chan_voter</code>) along with <code>app_rpt</code> under Asterisk PBX. The host-based system on which this runs, along with a dedicated hardware device (which gives access to the precise GPS-derived time data) is typically located with the system's transmitter (or at least one of them).</p> <p>Each dedicated hardware device is also capable of simultaneously generating time-synchronized audio out to drive a transmitter (or multiple transmitters in a simulcast system). The audio out of all the dedicated hardware devices at all locations will be identical at the same time.</p> <p>There are facilities available for online monitoring of the voting system (audio and signal strengths), in addition to recording (logging) facilities.</p>"},{"location":"voter/about-voter/#why-a-96mhz-clock","title":"Why a 9.6MHz Clock?","text":"<p>A question that often gets asked (in relation to doing simulcast) is, \"why not just clock the dsPIC at 10MHz, instead of 9.6MHz\". Well, there is a very good reason that Jim picked that oscillator frequency, and a very good reason why you cannot use 10MHz.</p> <p>It comes down to timers and interrupts. In particular, the ADC servicing subroutine. </p> <p>With the way the dsPIC is configured with the 9.6Mhz oscillator, this subroutine is automatically called every 62.5uSec, as it is controlled by Timer 3 (TMR3).</p> <p>This subroutine is responsible for encoding the RX Audio Packets, and doing all the AtoD on the other analog inputs, RX Noise (for RSSI), Squelch Pot position, and Diode Voltage (temperature compensation).</p> <p>Every ODD time this subroutine is run, it encodes a RX Audio packet. Since this happens every OTHER time the ISR runs, that means it runs every 125uSec. Well, the reciprocal of 125uSec is 8kHz, so this is how we encode 8000 samples/sec of RX Audio! By default, encoding is ulaw, unless you SPECIFICALLY configure this client for ADPCM in <code>voter.conf</code>.</p> <p>Every EVEN time this ISR runs, it alternates measuring RX Noise, Squelch Pot Position, and Diode Voltage. So, each of those is measured every sixth time in, or every 375uSec. </p> <p>EVERY time this ISR runs, we bump some counters.</p> <p>Every time TMR3 expires, we service this routine and do an ADC conversion. We alternate between reading the RX Audio, and one of the other three channels (Squelch Noise, Squelch Pot position, and Diode (temp comp) voltage).</p> <p>So, as you can see, in order to encode ulaw/ADPCM audio at 8kHz, we need precise timing to take the ADC samples of the audio and encode them. Because of this precise timing, and the restrictions in the clock dividers in the dsPIC, it works out that 9.6MHz is the most suitable (common) crystal/clock to use.</p> <p>That said, some investigation has been done to see if there are any other suitable clocks. As it turns out, there may indeed be. Old CDMA wireless systems had GPSDO's that had a 9.8304MHz (CDMA 8x Chip) output that was locked to GPS (and there are lots of those still surplus). It would appear that there is a valid clock configuration for the dsPIC that could allow this clock signal to be used, and still maintain the 62.5uSec timer for the ISR. </p> <p>However, there is another problem presented with this approach, the bootloader. The bootloader is expecting a 9.6MHz clock to run, so it isn't going to like it if you feed it 9.8304MHz. We don't have the source code for the bootloader, so that is a more difficult change to implement. However, peeking in to the <code>.cof</code> file with a hex editor, one can find what seems to be the opcodes to set up the clock on the dsPIC when it boots. It may be possible to hack the bootloader to run at 9.8304Mhz. Further testing is required.</p> <p>Of course, this is only really of consequence if you are wanting to do simulcast, where everything needs to be precisely timed. For normal voting use, the standard 9.6MHz clock works just fine. If you are planning on doing simulcast transmitters, the crystal stability of the 9.6MHz oscillator is insufficient, you will need to provide an OCXO or GPS-derived 9.6MHz clock source to replace the crystal.</p>"},{"location":"voter/about-voter/#implementation","title":"Implementation","text":"<p>A UDP-based VoIP protocol was created specifically for this technology.

That means you also need to let the hardware/software (VOTER/RTCM) do the squelch action.</p> <p>If you need RX CTCSS, you'll need to feed logic from an external CTCSS decoder (ie an output from your radio) into the External CTCSS input pin.</p> <p>Also, don't disable COR in the RTCM/VOTER... it will cause it to disable the squelch and it will report an RSSI of 255 (full quieting) for all received signals. Setting COR to Ignore is only used in \"General-purpose\" mode, and allows you to feed processed audio in (instead of discriminator audio), as long as you are also sending COR (and/or) CTCSS in to the External CTCSS input to control the squelch (externally).</p> <p>The RTCM/VOTER is totally flexible regarding emphasis. Although the way it is set is completely obscure. It tries to automatically do the right thing for you, which is great, most of the time. But when it\u2019s not, it's hard to know what is going on. </p> <p>If you are changing the COR Type settings, or using <code>nodeemp</code> in <code>voter.conf</code>, make sure you save/reboot the RTCM/VOTER every time you make a change... changes are not effective until the RTCM/VOTER reboots!</p>"},{"location":"voter/voter-audio/#chuck-squelch","title":"Chuck Squelch","text":"<p>Early versions of firmware had flavors that included \"Chuck Squelch\".

We have 6dB/octave from 1kHz to 2kHz, but 4dB/octave from 2kHz to 3kHz, and 3dB/octave from 3kHz to 4kHz. </p> <p>Tried sweeping the de-emphasis filter directly (U14 Pin 3 to U14 Pin 5), but there was too much loading, and not enough signal was recoverable (probably an interaction with the test setup).</p> <p>If we do a little circuit analysis here, we can see this is probably a design issue.</p> <p>The gain is coming from the relationship of R37/R38. In an inverting amplifier, this is going to give us a gain of 100/33=3.3, or 20log3.3=10.37dBv. That is pretty darn close to the about 9.6dBv (15.8-6.2) that was measured.</p> <p>If we solve for Fc using R37/C31 (1/(2*pi*R*C)), we get 339Hz. Again, that is pretty close to the about 370Hz actually measured (that's within 10%, which is easily accounted for in the C31 tolerance, and the cheezy test setup). We would normally want Fc to be 212Hz for LMR applications.</p> <p>Of note, solving for the time constant of R37/C31, we get 470uS... one would have expected that to have been 750uS.</p> <p>So, I would say this is an unfortunate design oversight. The problem is, correcting it in the future would mean incompatibility with all the existing VOTER/RTCM's out there.

It could be showing the year as 1997. This is due to the date in the Thunderbolt being reported incorrectly.</p> <p>This can cause some of your voting receivers to not connect, if they are used with other GPS in your system. If you have ALL Thunderbolts, or NO Thunderbolts, you are probably fine. If you have ALL Thunderbolts, the date/time is probably wrong, but they will ALL be wrong, so they will connect.</p> <p>GPS Time is a continuous counting time scale beginning at the January 5, 1980 to January 6, 1980 midnight. It is split into two parts: a time of week measured in seconds from midnight Sat/Sun, and a week number. The time of week is transmitted in an unambiguous manner by the satellites, but only the bottom 10 bits of the week number are transmitted. This means that a receiver will see a week number count that goes up steadily until it reaches 1023 after which it will \u201croll over\u201d back to zero, before steadily going up again. Such a week rollover will occur approx. every 20 years. A GPS week rollover occurred in 1999 and another one happened in 2019.</p> <p>The Thunderbolt manual states:</p> <p>\"The ThunderBolt adjusts for this week rollover by adding 1024 to any week number reported by GPS which is less than week number 936 which began on December 14, 1997. With this technique, the ThunderBolt will provide an accurate translation of GPS week number and TOW to time and date until July 30, 2017.\"</p> <p>As such, the Trimble Thunderbolt has a firmware issue with the GPS Week rollover that manifested itself on July 30, 2017, causing the date to become incorrect. The Thunderbolt thinks the week changed from 935 to 936 (actual week 1959-1024=935), so it stopped adding 1024 to the week.</p> <p>We have added a brute-force fix starting in RTCM/VOTER firmware &gt;=1.51. This fix adds 619315200 seconds (1024 weeks) to the time reported by the GPS. It fixes the Thunderbolts, we have not done extensive testing to see how it affects other TSIP receivers.</p> <p>That was fine until the week in the Thunderbolt hit the next rollover... when it rolled back to week 0, so additional checks were added, and now we have to add 2048 weeks (since the current GPS week is &gt;2048).

This should be set to the maximum expected network latency plus a little padding (800 samples is a good amount of padding, so setting the parameter to 3000 is probably a good place to start until you do buffer tuning) between the host and all the clients on the transmit side.

COR is determined in software (Squelch Calibration procedure). If you have External CTCSS configured, this would be the equivalent of AND squelch when set to <code>0</code>, needing CTCSS AND COR to qualify the receiver.

Therefore no repeat audio delay. Cool, eh? This duplex mode has been in the <code>app_rpt</code> for a while. The problem has been how to implement it in the VOTER environment. <code>Duplex Mode 3</code> support in the VOTER provides in-cabinet repeat functionality. Repeat audio loops through the VOTER, and has almost zero delay because it does not have to traverse the network. The delay is not quite zero but it's plenty short enough to eliminate all of the above mentioned annoyances. Of course, <code>Duplex Mode 3</code> support can't be used with voting or simulcast. You also lose DTMF muting, time out timer, and repeater disable functions because the repeat path is not through <code>app_rpt</code></li> <li><code>19 - Simulcast Launch Delay</code> set to anything other than <code>0</code> to enable.

It continues doing this every 20ms, as long as there is signal being received by the receiver. </li> <li>If the host approves of the client's response, it then uses the audio and/or GPS information provided by the client (and the flow continues).</li> <li>At any point, if either side does not approve of its peers authentication response, it must reply to its peer with a packet with a payload type of 0 (indicating that authentication needs to take place).</li> </ul> <p>The connection-less nature and the flexibility of this protocol allow the client to continue operating even if the host stops or changes its challenge string in mid-stream.</p> <p>Basically, when a client starts up, it just starts sending out packets, whether or not the host is there, or responding or responding positively. Once it receives valid authentication information from the host, it then is to send periodic GPS packets (once every second), and audio packets (once every 20/40ms) when there is audio to be sent (a signal is present on the receiver, or there is a signal to transmit). If, at any point the client gets responses from the host that do not contain valid authentication, it merely goes back to sending authentication packets once again, and the whole process repeats. Similarly, any time the host receives a packet from the client that does not contain valid authentication, it sends an authentication packet to the client.</p> <p>Therefore, the protocol is completely tolerant of interruptions in network connectivity, restarts of either or both sides of the connection, and accomplishes this quite easily and with very little complication and overhead.</p> <p>In summary, there are 7 cases of packets:</p> <ul> <li>24 octets, payload 0, digest 0 - This is only sent by a client</li> <li>24 octets, payload 0, digest (calculated) - This is only sent by a client</li> <li>25 octets, payload 0, digest (calculated), flags</li> <li>185 octets, payload 1, digest (calculated), 160 samples of Mu-law audio</li> <li>24 octets, payload 2, digest (calculated) - This is only sent by client</li> <li>50 octets, payload 2, digest (calculated), GPS data - This is only sent by client</li> <li>188 octets, payload 3, digest (calculated), 320 samples of ADPCM audio</li> <li>24-224 octets, payload 5, digest (calculated), up to 200 bytes for connectivity testing/verification</li> </ul> <p>A host will not send a packet to a client until the client has sent a packet for the host. Therefore the \"24 octets, payload 0, digest 0\" packets will only be sent by a client (since a digest of 0 indicates not yet hearing from a peer). A client may send as many payload 0 packets as is appropriate (there really is no limit). A host must respond to each of these packets.</p> <p>Presence of payload 1 and/or 3 packets indicates valid signal received or to be transmitted.</p> <p>For a \"receive-only\" implementation, the host may only send payload 0 packets in response to packets from the client. It need not send any payload 1 or 3 packets if doing so is inappropriate. A client need not keep intrinsic track of date information (such as a real-time clock, etc). The client may, if no other means is available, determine current date (not including time of day) from the time information in the authentication packet last received from the host. Therefore, the host must send time information that has an accurate date (accurate time is not required).</p>"},{"location":"voter/voter-protocol/#general-purpose-mode-operation","title":"\u201cGeneral-Purpose\u201d Mode Operation","text":"<p>For non-GPS-based uses, a client and host may send audio packet sequence numbers in lieu of accurate real-time information. In order to facilitate this operation, the client and host must negotiate \u201cgeneral-purpose\u201d mode operation at authentication time by passing (and responding to) the \u201cgeneral-purpose\u201d mode flag in the authentication packet.</p> <p>Both the client and host must maintain a \u201csequence number\u201d counter (the host must have a unique one for each client) which is intended to be initialized to zero upon initial connection to the host (completion of the authentication exchange), and be incremented every 20 milliseconds, synchronous with the transmission of any audio packets that may be sent (it must increment regardless of whether audio packets are actually being transmitted). Therefore, ADPCM (40 millisecond) audio streams will \u201cskip\u201d sequence numbers.</p> <p>When an audio packet is transmitted, the local device's sequence number is represented as the \u201cnanosecond\u201d part of the real-time field in the packet header (as opposed to actual time).

So, you have to compensate for these delays and by inserting a launch delay that is equivalent to the delay to get from the host to the furthest site in all the other sites, so that the audio/data actually gets sent out over the air at the same time from all transmitters.</p> <p>The audio (and/or data) being sent over the air has to be phase coherent (all in-phase). Otherwise, as the signals mix in the air, you will again end up with holes and other artifacts in the received signal.</p> <p>These are just a few of the many issues faced in building a simulcast system. Not for the weak of heart, but it is a lot of fun when it is working! Theoretically, (if you could get it coordinated and get enough sites) you could have a networked repeater system on the same frequency all over a state, with seamless coverage.</p> <p>The VOTER/RTCM boards do support simulcasting, however, there are a bunch of quirks that one needs to be aware of.</p>"},{"location":"voter/voter-simulcasting/#radio-hardware","title":"Radio Hardware","text":"<p>For best results, you should use all identical RF equipment between your voting RX sites and simulcast TX sites. </p> <p>If you don't, you can end up with strange audio artifacts when different receivers are used, and other strange audio issues when different transmitters are used.

The 1 PPS feed that you normally feed the VOTER/RTCM is acceptable for voting, but naturally, a typical crystal-driven clock will slightly drift in between the pulses every second due to inherent jitter, etc., and that isn't good for situations like simulcast which demand sample-accurate performance.</p> <p>Here are some comments from Joe, KC2IRV, on the subject. He has also created his own wiki, specific to simulcast issues, you can find it at: http://rtcmsimulcast.wikifoundry.com/. </p> <p>I felt I needed to let those on this mailing list know my findings with simulcasting with the RTCM units since I have received a great deal of help and information from people on this list.</p> <p>For the past week I have had a two (2) site simulcast system up and running on UHF using the RTCM units. I have done a great deal of testing and proving on the bench and it is so far working beautifully. </p> <p>The one issue that was made apparent to me early on was that in order for the RTCM's to be suitable for simulcast, the processor inside it needed to be clocked to a more accurate source. This source is supposed to be the Programmable Clock Generator Module in order to produce a GPS locked 9.6 MHz reference for the processor. Unfortunately this unit is not currently available.</p> <p>Knowing this, I started to go down the road of possibly designing my own, but stumbled upon a cheap, plentiful supply of Symmetricom 9.6 MHz sinewave OCXO's. I took a chance and ordered a few to experiment with to see if the RTCM would be able to use this in place of the supplied crystal for a clock. I found they did, with that I decided to modify the RTCM with an SMA connector just above the audio adjustment pots and use this OCXO. I trimmed the frequency on the units to match each other and used them to produce the processor clock.</p> <p>After a week of testing, I have found the results in the overlap areas to be exactly as I would expect them on a public safety/commercial simulcast system. While in an overlap region where both transmitters are within 3dB of one another, to the ear you hear no audio phase wandering. Of course, this has only been a week of testing so I wouldn't call it case closed yet.</p> <p>I will say that if this system remains this way after testing for 6 months to a year than using a 9.6 MHz OCXO is a viable alternative to achieve the needed precision and accuracy needed for the processor clock to make it suitable for simulcast.</p> <p>Comments from Jim Dixon on the issue:</p> <p>You have to use something that will take the precise 10MHz (or whatever it is) from the GPSDO and PLL (phase-locked) convert it to 9.6MHz (square wave at 3.3V for the CPU clock).</p> <p>We had to use 9.6MHz mainly because of the DAC in the dsPIC instead of 10MHz. The options for various divide/clock radios in the part are RATHER limited. As I recall, there wasn't even a way of getting the necessary 16kb/s sample rate on the ADC from 10MHZ, either.</p>"},{"location":"voter/voter-simulcasting/#micro-node-rtcm-clock-issue","title":"Micro-Node RTCM Clock Issue","text":"<p>James, KI0KN, had some strange-ness with some of his RTCM's when used for voting. As soon as he changed menu item 10 on the RTCM to either a (1) or a (0) instead of (2), he instantly got this on the RTCM console:</p> <pre><code>04/05/2016 18:44:13.660  Lost GPS Time synchronization\n04/05/2016 18:44:13.660  Host Connection Lost (Pri) (10.16.1.240)\n</code></pre> <p>And it sits there forever and never re-establishes connection to the host. The issue was finally traced to a bad batch of 9.6MHz crystals that affected a small run of the RTCM's. The issue was eventually resolved by Micro-Node, but we'll document it here just for record keeping.</p> <p>James comments to the mail list:</p> <p>Well, after many of you offered your time and thoughts on my voter problem, Jim, WB6NIL, graciously donated a couple of hours of his time to remotely help me and he uncovered the problem.</p> <p>All 5 of my RTCMs were purchased within the last 6 months, and I suspect all 5 have the same problem (will verify that today). The problem is that the microprocessor crystal is running too fast! There is 9.6Mhz crystal that drives the MPU, on the particular unit that Jim helped me diagnose, it's running 2.5khz too fast.  </p> <p>There is a sanity check in the firmware that makes sure the correct number of samples were taken in the last second (it's supposed to be 8000) and fails if the sample is incorrectly sized (mine is taking 8003 samples).  Jim helped adjust the code to be more tolerant of the sampling error and my whole system instantly worked.</p> <p>I have since tested it with ALL my GPSs (they all work great!). So I now have everything working, including the voting.</p> <p>I haven't contact Micro-Node about it yet. Jim told me that voting should work fine but this clock error would probably not be acceptable for Simulcast (something we have no plans on doing as of now). Since mine are deployed at mountain top sites, I'll probably pursue a crystal that is running at the correct frequency and use \"standard\" firmware so that if the decision is ever made to play with simulcast, I won't be right back in this same boat.</p> <p>Thanks to all that helped out, and a HUGE thanks to Jim for taking the time to troubleshoot this.</p> <p>BTW- This clock error will NOT effect the RTCM in mix client mode, it only affects it in voting or simulcast mode!</p> <p>In voter.c, the stock line is:</p> <pre><code>if ((samplecnt &gt;= 7999) &amp;&amp; (samplecnt &lt;= 8001))\n\nit needs to be changed to something like:\n\nif ((samplecnt &gt;= 7999) &amp;&amp; (samplecnt &lt;= 8003 ))\n</code></pre> <p>That was just enough to make my first RTCM work. I've had a chance now to check a few more of my RTCMs on the bench this morning and the crystal frequencies are kind of all over. The next one I had on the bench was 5.2Khz fast. The above code was still not enough to fix it (as would be expected) so it looks like the quality control on whatever manufacturer that crystal is, isn't very good (or a low tolerance crystal is being used). I am going to pursue crystal replacement to get a highly accurate, stable, on-frequency crystal in there as my first choice. Changing the firmware 5 different times doesn't seem like the right answer.</p> <p>Jim put that sanity check in there for a reason. Working around it '''may''' allow the device to work, but to me, it seems getting the hardware operating the way it was supposed to originally is the better answer. I will follow up with Micro-node and let you all know how it goes.</p> <p>After following up with Micro-Node:</p> <p>They were all off, some were off a LOT. I talked to Mark @ Micronode. He told me there were 25 units that made it out the door with a crystal from an unapproved source and that was quite likely the reason for the problem. He gladly sent me 5 new crystals to replace (he offered to replace them himself if I sent the units in, but I am comfortable doing it myself to save the time and postage). </p> <p>I haven't received them in the mail yet to show that the problem is fixed, but I will post here when that happens. He was great to work with and had no issue getting things set straight. If you are having the same issue and your RTCMs were bought about the same time, I'd suggest you contact him and have him help you resolve the issue!</p>"}]}
