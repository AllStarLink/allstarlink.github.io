The reason is that AllStarLink works exclusively with public IP addresses.

Additionally both nodes cannot use the same UDP port as they will fight over it with the NAT/router.</p> <p>For this example, let's consider two nodes on the same subnet. The nodes are:</p> Node Local IP 630010 192.168.0.10 630011 192.168.0.11 <p>These nodes are behind a NAT/router with a public IP address of 203.0.113.186.</p> <p>When each node connects and registers with AllStarLink, its perceived registration IP address will be 203.0.113.186. If another node asks \"where is node 630010\" it  would get back the answer 203.0.113.186. However, this is also the case for the internal nodes. If node 630011 asks \"where is node 630010\" it also gets back 203.0.113.186. For various network reasons, this will not work.</p> <p>One also has to consider the UDP port.

Larger text blocks may take tens of seconds to compile. asl-tts is not appropriate for time-sensitive communications such as speaking the current time.</p> <p>The command format is as follows: <pre><code>asl-tts -n NODE -t 'TEXT' [ -v VOICE ] [ -f FILE ]\n</code></pre></p> <p>The general use case is to speak to a node immediately.

In general, the <code>\"</code> and <code>'</code> work the same by the double-quote will allow variable substitution while the single quote will not. This can be useful if you want to create text based on a system condition. For example:</p> <pre><code>TODAY=$(date +\"%A, %B %d, %Y\")\nsudo asl-tts -n 63001 -t \"Today is ${TODAY}\"\n</code></pre> <p>Obviously the above example is a bit contrived as the <code>date</code> command doesn't generate nice words such as \"first\", \"seventeenth\", etc. However it demonstrates the flexibility of the tool. A script could be used to populate <code>$TODAY</code> with natural words. For a hypothetical example:</p> <pre><code>TODAY=$(/path/to/today-script)\nsudo asl-tts -n 63001 -t \"Today is ${TODAY}\"\n</code></pre> <p>More complex message can be created with additional shell coding.

Radio equipment such as HTs or mobile radios, and many electronics products such as VOIP phones often restrict end-user audio adjustment capabilities to ensure consistent audio levels. Allstar nodes and USB interfaces however generally allow greater flexibility and thus extra attention is required to be sure your audio interface gains are properly matched to the external audio input and output levels. Otherwise your audio levels could be much quieter or louder than they should be which could be disruptive to other users and systems.</p> <p>Most nodes use the SimpleUSB channel driver. Nodes that require more advanced features such as DSP squelch detection, CTCSS tone encode/decode or additional audio filtering options will use the USBRadio channel driver. These channel drivers both have tune utilities for setting audio levels and other functions. Once a node has been configured in the <code>asl-menu</code> \"AllStar Node Setup Menu\", select the \"Interface Tune CLI\" menu option. The following options should then be used to check and optimize audio level settings:</p> <p>Note: Be sure you are not connected to any other nodes when doing any of the following tests and adjustments.</p> <ul> <li><code>Set Rx Voice Level (using display)</code> provides a level meter. Talk at a normal and steady volume into the microphone and be sure that the average level does not go past the \"3KHz\" point, and that peak levels do not go significantly past the \"5KHz\" point. Note that for proper mic technique you should talk no closer than 2 to 3 inches (5 - 10 cm) from the microphone, and it should be held at an angle to minimize pops/plosives. Once you see where the audio levels are hit the Enter key and you'll then be prompted to change the setting. If for example the current setting is 500 and your levels were too high, try entering 400 for a new value and then repeat the test. Continue to iteratively adjust the settings until the average audio levels stay around the \"3KHz\" mark. For a more precise calibration with radio nodes a 1KHz test tone can be input into another radio at a level that results in 3KHz FM deviation, then calibrate the node to the 3KHz mark, however this can be more complicated to set up and may not account for other differences such as different mics or mic gain settings.</li> <li><code>Set Transmit A Level</code>, <code>Set Transmit B Level</code> (or <code>Set Transmit Voice Level</code> for USBRadio) allow the node audio output levels to be set. For nodes connected to a radio transceiver the level should be set such that the transmitted FM deviation is no higher than 3KHz and the audio does not sound distorted or overly loud. When listening on another radio it can also be helpful to confirm the audio levels from your node sound about the same as levels on FM repeaters in your area.</li> <li><code>Toggle RX Boost</code> enables a preamp in the CM1xx for use with very low mic-level input signals, This should be disabled in almost all cases.</li> <li><code>View Rx Audio Statistics</code> shows precise audio level information. If when running this option and talking at a normal to loud volume into your mic you see <code>Pk</code> levels of any higher than -3.0 dBFS, <code>Avg Pwr</code> levels of higher than -12 dBFS, or any <code>ClipCnt</code> value greater than 0, you should reduce your rxmix setting (using the <code>Set Rx Voice Level</code> menu option) and then repeat this step. (\"dBFS\" is a logarithmic unit of measurement where 0dBFS equals the Full-Scale (largest possible) value of a digital signal. Digital signals cannot exceed 0dBFS. If an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is overdriven, clipping, distortion and greatly reduced audio quality results.)</li> <li><code>Toggle Echo Mode</code> will record each of your transmissions and echo (\"parrot\") back to you. After setting your levels with the above menu options first, echo tests are the final step to confirm your audio is clear and intelligible. If anything does not sound right or you have any questions be sure to visit the AllStarLink forum for additional help. When done with Echo Mode testing don't forget to then disable it. (DTMF commands can be enabled to make it easy to do echo testing any time. To enable parrot mode DTMF commands uncomment the 3 lines in <code>/etc/asterisk/rpt.conf</code> that start with <code>921 =</code>, <code>922 =</code>, and <code>923 =</code>. Then restart Asterisk or reboot the node. Entering <code>*921</code> on a DTMF keypad will then enable parrot mode and <code>*922</code> will disable it.)</li> <li><code>Print Current Parameter Values</code> shows the current audio level settings.</li> <li><code>Write (Save) Current Parameter Values</code> saves any changed settings to disk. Be sure to execute this option before exiting the menu if you have changed any settings and want those to be the new defaults.</li> </ul> <p>The tune utilities can also be run from the command line without needing to use <code>asl-menu</code>. For SimpleUSB run \"sudo /usr/sbin/simpleusb-tune-menu\" or for USBRadio run \"sudo /usr/sbin/radio-tune-menu\".</p>"},{"location":"adv-topics/usbinterfaces/#eeprom-operation","title":"EEPROM Operation","text":"<p>The SimpleUSB and USBRadio channel drivers allow users to store configuration information in a EEPROM IC attached to the C-Media CM1xx USB Interface IC.

When the write is complete, eject the card, remove the card from computer and insert it into the Pi. If using a USB adapter for the SD card, remove the SD card from the adapter and insert the card into the Pi. The Pi will not use the SD card in the USB adapter.</p> </li> <li> <p>Power on the Pi. Wait approximately 2 to 5 minutes for the Pi to boot and perform the various first boot tasks. Depending on the type of a Pi board used, this process could be lengthy. If there is a screen connected to the Pi, it will be noted that Pi will reboot several times. This is normal and expected.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Network connectivity may be tested using the command to ping the hostname set in step 10. For example, if the hostname set was \"node63001\" then do <code>ping -4 node63001.local</code> from a command prompt or PowerShell window. When you get a response, the host is connected to the network.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Open the browser on your computer and navigate to <code>https://nodeNNNNN.local</code>. In this example the name was <code>node63001</code> then one would enter <code>https://node63001.local</code>. Your Pi and your computer must be on the same LAN for this to work. Use the IP address rather than the hostname if the Pi is on a remote network or the hostname is unreachable. Depending on your network and browser, one may have to enter the name several times until the page displayed. The first connection will report a message that \"Your connection isn't private\". For the Pi appliance, this is acceptable. Click on Advanced and then Continue to node63001.local (unsafe). This only must be done the first time.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>The AllStarLink Launchpad will appear. Clicking on Web Admin Portal will take one to the web-based administration portal that includes a web-based SSH client for using asl-menu and other commands. Clicking on Node Links will take one to the Allmon3 interface. Clicking on ASL Manual will take one to the top of this manual.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>To setup the new node, click on Web Admin Portal. Similar to step 20, click Advanced and Continue to node63001.local (unsafe) to see the logon box.This only must be done the first time. Enter the username and password configured during the imaging process above. Click Log in</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>The Overview tab is displayed. Using the Web Admin Portal (Cockpit)  with AllStarLink is covered in the manual. At the top,  click on *Turn on administrative access</p> <p></p> <p>Enter the password again when prompted and click Authenticate</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>The web-based SSH console appears as Terminal at the bottom of the left scrollable menu. Click it and SSH console will appear:</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> <p>The Terminal window is a complete interface to AllStarLink, Asterisk, and more.
